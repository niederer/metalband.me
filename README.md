metalband.me
============
# About this project
Metalband.me is a metal band name generator.  It selects from a predefined list of words to serve the user the perfect name for their awesome new metal band.  This project takes an iterative approach - so you may see some "ugly" code along the way as we flesh things out.

## Project goals
- Create an interface that generates killer metal band names from a database of metal vocabulary
- Save word combinations and keep track of how often they show up as a result
- Handle pre-existing band names that show themselves during name generation
